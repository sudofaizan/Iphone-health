### how to verify battery is orignal not boosted?

if ~Total cycle count~  is more then ~ Max design cycle~
its boosted dont buy that iphone

if ~Actual battey healtht~  is not more then or less then 7 points variation in settings/battery/health of iphone then its real battery health
example.

in setting>battery>health you see 100%
and with this tool you see 92 % > then its real.

if its showing less then 92 % then its fake or manipulated battery.
